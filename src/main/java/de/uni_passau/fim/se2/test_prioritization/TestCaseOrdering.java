     * Performs an elementary transformation of the given configuration.
     * <p>
     * Implementations must ensure that the following contract is never violated: If the current
     * configuration is a valid admissible solution to the problem at hand, then the returned
     * configuration must represent a valid and admissible solution as well.
     * <p>
     * Furthermore, elementary transformations should obey the following rules to increase the
     * likelihood for the algorithm to converge towards an optimal solution:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>
     *          They should be <em>reversible</em>, that is, if we go from configuration A to
     *          configuration B via an elementary transformation it should also be possible
     *          to go back from B to A using another elementary transformation.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         Any feasible system configuration should be reachable in a <em>finite</em>
     *         number of transformations.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         They should not have any <em>fixed points</em>, that is, no configuration can
     *         be its own neighbor. Furthermore, elementary transformations should choose a
     *         <em>random</em> neighbor among all admissible ones every time they are invoked.
     *     </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Note that the elementary transformation determines the neighborhood of a configuration.
     * Together with a fitness function, it defines the fitness landscape. Usually, smooth fitness
     * landscapes benefit the search, whereas rugged fitness landscapes tend to hinder the search.
     * <p>
     * An elementary transformation should not exhibit any side effects, such as changing the
     * internal state of the current configuration.
