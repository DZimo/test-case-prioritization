/**
 * Put your unit tests here for the code you implemented in the
 * {@link de.uni_passau.fim.se2.test_prioritization} package. Try to achieve as high branch and line
 * coverage as possible. You may find a test-driven development approach helpful. Also, design your
 * classes with testability in mind. For example, try to break complex algorithms and classes down
 * into smaller pieces and try not to hardcode parameters. Instead, allow your tests to set such
 * parameters via dependency injection (e.g. by providing appropriate constructors).
 * <p>
 * You need not test any of the code that was already given to you, in particular, you need
 * not create tests for {@link de.uni_passau.fim.se2.Main} and {@link de.uni_passau.fim.se2.Bridge}.
 * <p>
 * You can use the following testing frameworks (but there is no obligation to use all of them):
 * JUnit 5, Google Truth, Hamcrest, Mockito and Powermock.
